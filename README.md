## Assignemnt 4: Single-view and two-view geometry![Uploading combined.pngâ€¦]()

Fundamental Matrix Estimation, Camera Calibration, Triangulation

## Assignment 5: Affine factorization and binocular stereo
Part 1: Affine Factorization
The goal of this part of the assignment is to implement the Tomasi and Kanade affine structure from motion method as described in lecture. You will be working with Carlo Tomasi's 101-frame hotel sequence.
Part 2: Binocular Stereo
The goal of this part is to implement a simple window-based stereo matching algorithm for rectified stereo pairs.
