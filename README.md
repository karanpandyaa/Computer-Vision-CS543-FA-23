## Assignment 2: Fourier-based Alignment and Finding Covariant Neighborhoods
Algorithm outline
```
The Fourier-based alignment algorithm consists of the following steps:
- For two color channels C1 and C2, compute corresponding Fourier transforms FT1 and FT2.
- Compute the conjugate of FT2 (denoted as FT2*- if you don't remember your complex numbers, look this up!), and compute the product of FT1 and FT2*.
- Take the inverse Fourier transform of this product and find the location of the maximum value in the output image. Use the displacement of the maximum value to obtain the offset of C2 from C1.
```

## Assignment 3: Homography stitching, shape from shading
Part 1: Stitching pairs of images
The first step is to write code to stitch together a single pair of images.

## Assignemnt 4: Single-view and two-view geometry![Uploading combined.pngâ€¦]()

Fundamental Matrix Estimation, Camera Calibration, Triangulation

## Assignment 5: Affine factorization and binocular stereo
Part 1: Affine Factorization
The goal of this part of the assignment is to implement the Tomasi and Kanade affine structure from motion method as described in lecture. You will be working with Carlo Tomasi's 101-frame hotel sequence.
Part 2: Binocular Stereo
The goal of this part is to implement a simple window-based stereo matching algorithm for rectified stereo pairs.
